# Research state and open obligations

Updated 7 October 2026. This is the single maintained state/task file.
Follow [the current handoff](HANDOFF-2026-10-06-REWORKED-SOURCES.md) and
[GOALS.md](GOALS.md). Previous session logs and task snapshots are in Git.
The historical-file refactor and source-only cleanup were committed and
pushed as `60180f2`; the user released the review hold.

## Historical target

Proposition I comes first, then II, III and IV, separately for the De Motu
witnesses, 1687 and 1713. Read the exact Latin proof and its invoked results
in each historical Lean file. A source citation or unused import is not a
formal dependency.

The trajectory is given explicitly. Mechanical laws and needed regularity are
separate premises. Proposition I must prove **A**, swept-sector area proportional
to time. **B**, nonnegative area between polygon and curve, controls the
approximation where used. The position–velocity determinant is supporting
work. Neither A, B nor polygon/curve agreement is part of trajectory existence.

## What is proved and what remains

| Result or bridge | Retained checked result | Open historical obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lemma I | Separate 1687/1713 positive-terminal-difference contradictions, including an actual positive before-end time window; rational terminal-zero consequence | Terminal comparisons and approach premises are supplied; terminal values are not constructed. No general equality of objects is inferred from an unspecified difference |
| Lemma II | Exact equal-width gap, actual rectangle-union side-product areas under explicit partial area rules, derived enclosure/errors and unit ratios to a fixed positive assigned rational curved area; actual use of the edition's Lemma I | Existence of the geometric area convention and the curve's area remain premises; arbitrary non-rational areas and ratios of two varying areas require further treatment |
| Lemma III | Maximum-width exhaustion, actual use of Lemma II's geometric enclosure and Lemma I's contradiction; area errors and fixed-area unit ratios for unequal widths | Same area scope as Lemma II; mesh exhaustion must be established for the particular force polygons |
| Lemma III corollaries I–IV | Source-local chain: conditional area approximation, rectangle endpoint covers, two-sided chord/supporting-segment approximation to a supplied rational curve under uniform continuity and shrinking mesh | Rectangle covers are not staircase perimeters. Supporting cells are supplied; actual tangents, the circumscribed figure's area and force-polygon correspondence remain open. No arclength conclusion |
| Laws' Corollary I | Endpoint constraints, unique intersection and central-cell composition; separate printed-edition derivations from supplied Law I inertia and calibrated Law II additive-change predicates | Mechanical laws are premises, not geometry theorems. Only 1713 explicitly cites Laws II/I in this proof; De Motu hypotheses and finite models remain witness-local |
| Proposition I | Finite equal-area/componendo steps; modern constructed-curve and conditional given-curve fan laws | Historical swept-sector proof through invoked results, sector-area identification and approximation of the given curve |
| Proposition II | Finite oriented-area converse, including unequal durations and uniformly moving centres | Vanishing-triangle/continuous-curve passage. Direction does not determine inward sense; unsigned areas and a vertex at the centre require separate treatment |
| Proposition III | Relative deflection and reference-history cancellation; finite converse application | Realized relative-orbit limit. No Law III, mass/force law or force/time-scale conclusion is derived |
| Proposition IV | Conditional finite circular sagitta comparison | Circle geometry, force interpretation and edition-specific ultimate ratios: 1687 uses Proposition II and Lemmas V/XI; 1713 uses Proposition II, Proposition I corollaries 2/4 and Lemma VII |
| Lemmas IX–XI support | Conditional quadratic/contact arithmetic and coefficient rearrangements in the owning historical files | Actual curved contact, mechanical velocity-area enclosure and variable-force comparisons; regularity/finite-curvature clauses stay edition-local |

No complete historical Proposition I–IV proof is certified. These retained
results are finite, conditional or modern reconstructions in their stated
domains. There is no theorem-count or percentage completion metric.

## Retained construction and deferred applications

The general ModernLib construction uses regional force contracts, a calibrated
short window and explicit finite bounds. Actual, coarse and both shadow sample
locations are derived before force evaluation. Completed force values use
certified regional representatives; curve radii follow from the finite
invariant. The former whole-plane premise is removed. Confinement uses L1
coordinate bounds, not an established Euclidean Kepler force law.

Endpoint/prefix constructions, dyadic-time agreement, a local continuous
binary-time state map and whole-edge polygon control remain available.
General interior-time agreement, window gluing, arbitrary partition independence
and external real-time identification remain open. Active harmonic instances
and controls are retained; historical-file reachability alone does not decide
whether supporting work is useful.

`GeneralForceArea` proves local all-interval unsigned fan area
`abs(ell)*abs(elapsed)/2`, including reversal and zero cases. Fans count
multiplicity; ordinary sector-union area is not established. Actual matched
regions have canonical nonnegative square outer content with a proved geometric
bound and decay. Shared `BinaryLift`, polygon and matched-region geometry avoid
separate completion and alias proofs for each client.

`GivenTrajectoryArea` proves polygon identification, interval fan proportionality
and separate B under `Consistency`: independent rational curve samples,
candidate-arrival region membership, a local mechanical residual and shrinking
full-grid source budget. Area and polygon agreement are conclusions. Deriving
consistency from independent motion laws remains open. Its modern historical
wrappers stay below the five-line anachronical separator, along with the
completed rectangle and supporting-boundary applications.

Velocity/force secants, normalized second departure, tangent triangles and
harmonic potential increments remain modern support. Unrestricted difference
quotients, general radial potential steps and the centre-at-infinity time map
are deferred. The Euclidean Kepler 1/r² instance follows the general Proposition
I proof as an application. Weaker force classes need separate convergence and
uniqueness statements, with counterexamples where appropriate.

## Sources, diagnostics and immediate work

NATP00089 and NATP00090 retain separate revisions. Their area arguments do not
cite a numbered limiting lemma; do not give them the printed Lemma III citation.
LemmaI.lean houses the exact NATP00090 par12–13 Lemma 2 passage and a conditional
enclosing-ratio reconstruction of its unnumbered exhaustion step. This is an
editorial comparison with printed Lemma I, not De Motu's numbered Lemma 1 (motion
composition), and not a newly asserted dependency of its Theorem 1. NATP00089's
unnumbered terminal assertion remains with its Theorem 1 in AreaLaw.lean.
Proposed 1694 and 1726 remain comparison witnesses. Earliest H4 chronology,
direct C42 text and exact draft-folio identification remain source gaps.
The edited Rouse Ball witness and its limits are in [sources.md](sources.md).

The [action arguments](action-arguments/README.md) remain a separate diagnostic
layer. Positivity, finiteness, partition stability, system independence and
action rescaling are distinct tests. No universal constant or quantum premise
closes a historical proof.

The next increment is to connect Proposition I's actual force polygons and
given trajectory to these explicit geometric/regularity premises, then prove
ordinary swept-sector identification and B. Do not infer either from rational
boundary approach or from multiplicity-counted fan sums. The groundwork has
checked conditional increments; the full historical statements remain subject
to the restrictions above. Use [verification](VERIFICATION.md) and
read the different scope of [source/compiled-use diagrams](figures.md).
